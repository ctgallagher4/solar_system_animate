# To-Do List (will be updated as I go)

* Implement RK-4 methods in python or C
* Interface with C if necessary for speed
* Implement celestial body object classes

* Implement matplotlib animations
* Implment read from csv functionality


# Timeline for final project idea #1

* By the end of week 4, I will have read up on implementing Runge-Kutta methods in Python and C.

* By the end of week 5, I will have implemented object classes for celestial bodies which contain attributes such as position, velocity, and mass and the ability to read these from a csv file.

* By the end of week 6, I will have decided what to do about collisions. Obviously this is a complex problem physically so I will probably just have two collision types like "sticky" and "non-sticky". From there I will need to implement some sort of momentum transfer. This will take some research and some remembering basic pool table physics. (I chose another option - don't worry about collisions.)

* By the end of week 7, I will have finished implementing Runge-Kutta methods.

* By the end of week 8, I will have a matplotlib animation of the entire system.

Finally, I will structure all of these files in a good way and clean things up.

# To run the program:
1) clone the repository
2) edit sample_simulation.py or make your own
3) choose the csv of your choice or edit the currrent csv
4) run sample_simulation.py or your own simulation
5) wait for a confirmation plot to load
6) click X and wait for the video to render
7) navigate to the name of the video in sample_simulation.py
